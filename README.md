## Limitations and considerations

* Right now, the extension assumes you have ExpressVPN with an activated license.

* The extension, at the moment depends on this packages being installed:

    * systemd (used to activate/deactivate the expressVPN service)
    * pkexec (used to run systemd commands as administrator)

* The regions shown in the panel menu, are missing sub-regions. For example, USA has 23 regions in total, but just the default will be printed for now.
